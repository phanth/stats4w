#get the y from training set

```
Next step...

- Find relevant predictors by the Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Generate MSE plot on cross-validation from `sample()` function
- Get `model.matrix()` to work to get a matrix of training set 
          - Get the grid parameter for lambda
          - create the model for lasso model
